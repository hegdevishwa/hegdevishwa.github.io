In the peak pandemic, I needed something to pass my time, so decided to create a blog site.
g
I initially thought of handcrafting myself with the ReactJs as I though this will be a learning for me but soon realized it's going to be not easy as I don't like CSS that much. Though I  had a bit of experience working with react I don't consider myself as an expert UI developer. I took quiet a lot of time to bring up something meaningful. More than writing I spent lot of time trying to adjust divs in CSS.

So I ditched the idea and started exploring a simple tool that gives me simple way to write without fighting CSS. 

* [Wordperess](https://wordpress.org/) - It's a time tested tool to create simple websites with rich content management. But needs a backend to host the website and database as well. I was thinking of hosting in AWS but that could cost me a lot over the long run.
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - Looked interesting, with ReactJs and GraphQL but I found it very complex for a simple site generation
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Can be hosted with GitHub pages, but I found the Liquid themes not very intuitive. 
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Found it easy to configure & manage. Can add themes as Git submodule. There are some nice simple themes available.

So finally here it is - Hugo + Coder theme, exactly what I was looking for.
