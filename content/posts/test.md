So in the peak pandamic, I needed someting to pass my time, so decided to create a blog site.

I initially thought of handcrafting myself with the ReactJs as I thout this will be a learning for me but soon realised it's going to be not easy as I don't like CSS that much. Though I  had a bit of experince working with react I don't consider myself as an expert UI developer. I took quiet a lot of time to bring up someting meaningful. More than writing I spent lot of time trying to adjust divs in CSS.

So I diteched the idea and went out with a mission to find a tool that gives me everying. 

* [Wordperess](https://wordpress.org/) - It's a time tested tool to cretae simple websites with rich content managemtnt. But needs a backend to host website and database as well. I was thinking of hosting in AWS but that could cost me a lot over long run
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - Looked interesting, with ReactJs and GraphQL but I found it very complex for a simple site generation
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - Can be hosted with GitHub pages, but I found the Liquid themes not very intutive. 
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - Found it easy configure & manage. There are sime nice simple themes available.
